            To be able to begin chatting with someone, first input a name that you would like to go by during the
            chat,
            please be respectful, to the name input. The key input is used to help connect to the person or people you would
            like
            to chat with, acting as the shared instance that connects everyone consisting of five digit code. With these inputs filled, you'll be
            able
            to click the submit button which will attempt to send you to a chat room with the person that has the
            shared
            key. When successful you will be able to begin chatting with the person, if unsuccessful it sends you
            back
            to the starting page to prompt another attempt to connect via the submit button or changing the key
            variable
            if the issue lies there.
