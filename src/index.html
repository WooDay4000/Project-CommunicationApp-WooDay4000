            To begin chatting with someone, first, put a name into the name input you would like to go by during the
            chat, please be respectful. Second, put a key into the key input, this is used to help connect to the person
            or people you would like to chat with, with this being a 5-digit code that you create. If you're having
            trouble finding someone to talk with, simply use a key where all five digits are the same number from 1 to
            9. With those inputs filled, you'll be able to click the "Submit" button which will attempt to send you to a
            chat room with the person or people that has the shared key. When successful you can begin chatting with the
            person, if unsuccessful it sends you back to the starting page to prompt another attempt to connect via the
            submit button.
