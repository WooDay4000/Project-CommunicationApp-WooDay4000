            Instructions<br>
            ------------<br>
            To be able to begin chatting with someone, first input a name that you would like to go by during the chat,
            please be respectful, to the name input. The key input is used to help connect to the person you would like
            to chat with, acting as the shared instance that connects the two. With these inputs filled, you'll be able
            to click the submit button which will attempt to send you to a chat room with the person that has the shared
            key. When successful you will be able to begin chatting with the person, if unsuccessful it sends you back
            to the starting page to prompt another attempt to connect via the submit button or changing the key variable
            if the issue lies there.
